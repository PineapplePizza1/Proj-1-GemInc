///Script to fire bullets enemy
//arg0 = timeline to fire bullets. can be instantaneous, or can be a pause and shoot, or a machine gun, etc.
//arg1 = bullet type
//arg2 = direction of fire
//arg3 = bulletspeed
//timeline is alright to use, btw. since timelines represent states, if anytime we need to continue in the same spot, we can adjust easily in state machine, though that shouldn't be often.
