///@description start path if not on it, continue if stop.

//if on current path, fix it
//have transitions for start path, end path, and continue path.
//store the variables of where you left path, and mp_motion_step back to where tou left.

//on path, leave, get back on path, when gone. 
//shoot, like every once in a while if can.

//if see player, chase and take steps towards player. 
//Only shoot if you can see them, only takes a second. keep taking steps, as behavior. 
//activate shoot as timeline!!! standard shoot might be good.
//return to path if outside bounds or don't see player.
//maybe create a wall object that player can pass through, but enemies can't. safe zone. hard with collisions tho.
